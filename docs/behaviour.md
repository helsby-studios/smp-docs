# Behaviour Policy

Welcome to the CloudSMP Behaviour policy, here you will find what is expected of you in terms of behaviour in the minecraft server and further expands on the Server Rules. To start, you are always expected to be able to respect members and treat them as you too expect to be treated. Directed hate language or foul language is unacceptable and results in a level 1 - 2 punishment.

Staff's Judgement should not be challanged as they are trained to be able to recognise which punishment level is needed for the scenario however on the off chance there is a problem with this, you may speak to an admin or appeal your punishment using "/apply appeal" in the discord server.

Attempting to evade punishment or "Ghost" a member of staff will not be accepted and if you do not provide evidence/statement's on the issue you can be awarded a level 1 - 3 punishment as by doing such thing can be used as evidence that you are guilty of the "crime" 

More coming soon.
