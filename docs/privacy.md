# Privacy Policy

Welcome to the CloudSMP Privacy Policy, when we refer to the CloudSMP team we may use (us, our, we) please bare this in mind when reading this essential document.

As it has happened in the past we have banned and removed players from our community for breaking our server rules, privacy agreement and the terms of service agreement, no matter what you do on the server, however many hours you spend active, no matter how much you contributed/donated to the server you will be treated the same as everyone else and failing to comply with any legal documents such as our rules, tos or privacy policy will take you through the strike punishment system.

For TOS and Privacy it works differently though, if you break a minor thing on accident we will just ignore it but if something happens that severely breaks the documentation you can and will be immediatly banned with no further questions asked, bans from TOS and Privacy issues can not be appealed and will not have and reconsideration given to them.

## Our commitment to your safety

At CloudSMP (Cloud Team) we collect certain bits of information about you such as your minecraft user, discord user, guilded user and your age. we do this to make sure that everyone is playing with the right people, we do not want <13 year olds to be in the server as we can not collect and store any data about them due to UK data laws. All the information stored is in a safe and secure place monitored daily and checked repeatedly for and ways data could be leaked, absoluetly no information is shared outside of the staff team and we are trying to make this even more safe by implementing new measures such as only very high ranks having access to private data such as ages and only allowing staff that pass the safeguarding training that as of now will be conducated every month alongside a checkup on staff's mental health, safety and making sure that our team are still as commited and happy as day 1.

More coming soon.
