# Terms of Service

Welcome to the CloudSMP TOS, when we refer to the CloudSMP team we may use (us, our, we) please bare this in mind when reading this essential document.

As it has happened in the past we have banned and removed players from our community for breaking our server rules, privacy agreement and the terms of service agreement, no matter what you do on the server, however many hours you spend active, no matter how much you contributed/donated to the server you will be treated the same as everyone else and failing to comply with any legal documents such as our rules, tos or privacy policy will take you through the strike punishment system.

For TOS and Privacy it works differently though, if you break a minor thing on accident we will just ignore it but if something happens that severely breaks the documentation you can and will be immediatly banned with no further questions asked, bans from TOS and Privacy issues can not be appealed and will not have and reconsideration given to them.

## Refusal of service

CloudSMP is a free of charge whitelist only survival Minecraft multiplayer server, this means you can be denied access if we feel that your application to the server was basic or didn't give us a good idea on why we should give the position to you, we can also simply deny your application without a reason however if you feel that this was a mistake or done out of hate or discrimination we will reconsider your application and have the staff member that commited the crime punished.

## Having fun and playing 

CloudSMP is a place for all players of minecraft to be united and to play together in a fun and friendly way but when things that are not appropriate for the server age that are created/typed this can be a serious offence, using hate speach, descriminotary language or any kind of language to single a person out and make them feel upset or that they are different to everyone else will be taken very seriously as we will not tolerate someone who is making someone feel uncomfortable in the server, punishments such as official reports to mojang, discord and guilded can be filled out and you will be refused access to our services.

More to come soon.
